\section{Abstract}

By training machine learning (ML)-based classiers on electroencephalography (EEG) signals, researchers have built applications ranging from mind-controlled keyboards to prosthetic arms and hands. Unfortunately, these applications require elaborate scanning caps, and the data thse caps produce are large in memory and computationally expensive for classifiers process. This study seeks to acheive a high-bitrate brain-computer interface (BCI) with a single EEG sensor and minimal computational requirements. We found that a quantization technique employing logarithmically-spaced bins ``reduced vector size by 1/16'' without detriment to classification accuracy. This technique increased classification speed ``10*2^3(t) times over t seconds, and preserved decent classification accuracy at recordings of only x seconds.''  ``To the best of our knowledge, this system acheives the highest known bitrate on a single, dry EEG sensor.''
